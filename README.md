# Simple Steg

This script can simply encode an image into another image using LSB steganography. The image being encoded must have smaller or equal dimensions to the one it is being hidden in.

## Encoding
```python3 steg.py encode -B base.png -H hidden.png password```

## Decoding
```python3 steg.py decode -S secret.png password```


### Extra options

You can also use the option -b to specify the number of bits you want per channel for the hidden image in the base image
